# Ukraine War to Peace


This application has been built fully by the author ```John Oseni``` , But for some security and copyright issues, it's on a private repository for now, till monday, when the BETA version is gonna be launched

The routing and connection with the satellite in the space is still being worked on to perfection, The waitlist link would be dropped tomorrow morning for those whoe wanna get early access to it


And yes this application blocked access to ```Russian IP ADDRESSES,``` and also this application ask for access to your device, and scans for VPN on your device or any VPN extension you're using, This was created like that cause the russians might want to be using VPN, so using VPN for this application? 😂, It's never gonna work on your deviec 😂

So the full goal of the whole project codebase is to make millions and billions of people in ukraine go home safe and sound in ukraine ```while russian claims the war is still ongoing``` <br />

Of course, people might be thinking how does this application work?, 😂

Check this readme/ Repository by tomorrow, the waitlist would be dropped, then you gonna see how it works, 

The full application would be tested this Monday where ```John Oseni``` himself would go live on all social media platforms, if that doesn't work, the video would be dropped


And this doesn't work, it took me to read lots on articles on military and war artifacts and weapons, and ```John Oseni``` got to know they're all vulnerable to something, 

```Life is not all about building companies alone, but also being able to create something that would save the whole world from chaos```, <br />

Watch out for the waitlist tomorrow, and also the softwares being used are strictly confidential for now, cause it took me a whole lot risk to make this application come to live
